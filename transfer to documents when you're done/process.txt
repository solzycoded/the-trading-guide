1. I got a blog template from w3schools.com (- it's a simple design - it's easy to navigate - it's responsive - it's straightforward)

2. I downloaded wamp server and installed it
	i. there were missing dll files (they showed up during installation and whenever i start the wamp server), so i installed
	ii. Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012
	iii. Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2010
	iv. Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013
	- that solved that challenge

3. I had to reinstall wamp after going through 2.

	- apparently it's 'localhost/name of folder (inside the www folder)/name of script/file'

7. I remade the footer

8. I made a homepage

9. I made the posts section
	- i. cryptocurrency ii. forex iii. synthetic indices
